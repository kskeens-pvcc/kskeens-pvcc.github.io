    <h2>Introductions</h2>
    <il>The case of Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), was a landmark decision in which was ruled that it is unconstitutional to sentence people under the age of 18 to death. The death penalty on a minors violated the 8th and 14th amendments to the constitution.</il>
    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <il>Christopher Simmons created a plan, at age 17, to burglarize and murder a woman named Shirley Cook, 46. He was originally supposed to have two accomplices, but one of them decided he no longer wanted to be a part of this plan last minute. In the end, Simmons had one accomplice, and they ducted taped Miss Crook up then proceeded to take her from her home to Castlewood State Park. Near the park, they wrapped her up and threw her off a bridge into Meramec River. Her body was later discovered by fisherman. Simmons and Tessmer were arrested at their high school, and then taken to the police station for questioning. Simmons confessed to the murder and even did a videotaped reenactment of the whole process to the police. Along with that, his accomplice, John Tessmer, provided evidence that the murder was also premeditated. 
    </il>
    <h2>Missouri Court</h2>
    <il>Missouri's court tried Simmons as an adult and sentenced him to the death penalty after being charged with first degree murder, burglary, kidnapping, and stealing. Simmons tried to appeal to this decision stating that he was young, foolish, and had a very troubled past but all the appeals were rejected. That was until 2002 when the case of Atkins V. Virginia was ruled that a mentally ill person could not be executed because it violated the 8th and 14th amendments. This was due to the fact that a mentally retarded person could not appreciate a capital punishment or provide their own defense in court. The death sentence of people mentally challenged was deemed a cruel and unusual punishment by the US Supreme Court. Simmons appealed his case on the grounds that if it is a cruel and unusual punishment for a mentally challenged person, isn't it also cruel to sentence a minor to death? Missouri court stated that it did violate the 8th amendment because across the country people began to agree that the execution of juveniles was a cruel punishment. So, the state of Missouri appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.

    <h2>Supreme Court</h2>
    <il>In 2004, the appeal over the execution of juveniles over the age of 16 citing that it broke the 8th amendment made its way into court. This appeal would overrule the court decision of Thompson V. Oklahoma, no executions of offender under the age of 16, and Stanford V. Kentucky, which stated that capital punishment could be given to offenders of age 16 and 17. This case was appealed due to the overturning of the decision of Penry v. Lynaugh, in which mentally disabled are allowed to be executed, by Atkins V. Virginia. After looking over the evidence, research about minors' mentality, and taking into effect national consensus, the Supreme Court ruled that the execution of juveniles under the age of 18 did violate the 8th and 14th amendment.</il>
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <il>In the short term, the death sentences of a number of prisoners that had committed crimes as a juvenile and sentenced to death row for those crimes found their sentences canceled. The number of sentences changed varied across the U.S. This decision by the courts solidly defined the requirements of age for death row and banned the execution of juveniles. This also aligned our justice system with the system of other countries. This ruling is still in effect today and has impact many court cases since its ruling.</il>
